	abstract = {In the paper we study the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit in a channel domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times (-1,1)$ for the 3D kinetic Couette flow. Our results demonstrate that the first-order approximation of the solutions is governed by the perturbed incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system around the fluid Couette flow. Moverover, in the absence of external forces, the 3D kinetic Couette flow asymptotically converges over time to the 1D steady planar kinetic Couette flow.  Our proof relies on (i) the Fourier transform on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to essentially reduce the 3D problem to a one-dimensional one, (ii) anisotropic Chemin-Lerner type function spaces, incorporating the Wiener algebra, to control nonlinear terms and address the singularity associated with a small Knudsen number in the diffusive limit, and (iii) Caflischâ€™s decomposition, combined with the $L^2\cap L^\infty$ interplay technique, to manage the growth of large velocities.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the dynamics of fluids in porous media governed by Darcy's law: the Muskat problem. We consider the setting of two immiscible fluids of different densities and viscosities under the influence of gravity in which one fluid is completely surrounded by the other. This setting is gravity unstable because along a portion of the interface, the denser fluid must be above the other. Surprisingly, even without capillarity, the circle-shaped bubble is a steady state solution moving with vertical constant velocity determined by the density jump between the fluids. Taking advantage of our discovery of this steady state, we are able to prove global in time existence and uniqueness of dynamic bubbles of nearly circular shapes under the influence of surface tension. We prove this global existence result for low regularity initial data. Moreover, we prove that these solutions are instantly analytic and decay exponentially fast in time to the circle.},

We establish the global-in-time existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability for solutions nearby the relativistic Maxwellian to the special relativistic Boltzmann equation without any angular cutoff.  We work in the case of a spatially periodic box. We assume the generic hard-interaction and  soft-interaction conditions on the collision kernel that were derived by Dudy\'nski and Ekiel-Je$\dot{\text{z}}$ewska (Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{115}(4):607--629, 1988), and our assumptions include the case of Israel particles (J. Math. Phys. \textbf{4}:1163--1181, 1963).   In this physical situation, the angular function in the collision kernel is not locally integrable, and the collision operator behaves like a fractional diffusion operator.   We further derive the relativistic analogue of the Carleman dual representation of Boltzmann collision operator.  This is the first global existence and stability result for relativistic Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff and this resolves the open question of perturbative global existence without the Grad's angular cut-off assumption.},

	abstract = {Although the nuclear fusion process has received a great deal of attention in recent years, the amount of the mathematical analysis that supports the stability of the system seems to be relatively insufficient. This paper deals with the mathematical analysis of the magnetic confinement of the plasma via kinetic equations. We prove the global wellposedness of the \textit{Vlasov-Maxwell} system in a two-dimensional annulus when a huge (\textit{but finite-in-time}) external magnetic potential is imposed near the boundary. We assume that the solution is axisymmetric. This work is the first step to a more generalized work on the three dimensional Tokamak structure. The highlight of this work is from the physical assumptions on the external magnetic potential well which remains finite \textit{within a finite time interval} and from that we prove that the plasma never touches the boundary. In addition, we provide a sufficient condition on the magnitude of the external magnetic potential to guarantee that the plasma is confined in an annulus of the desired thickness which is slightly larger than the initial support. Our method uses the cylindrical-coordinate-forms of the \textit{Vlasov-Maxwell} system.},

@article{ChapmanJangStrain2020,
	abstract = {This article considers a long-outstanding open question regarding the Jacobian determinant for the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the center-of-momentum coordinates. For the Newtonian Boltzmann equation, the center-of-momentum coordinates have played a large role in the study of the Newtonian non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, in particular we mention the widely used cancellation lemma by Alexandre et al. (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 152(4):327--355, 2000). In this article we calculate specifically the very complicated Jacobian determinant, in ten variables, for the relativistic collision map from the momentum $p$ to the post collisional momentum $p'$; specifically we calculate the determinant for $p\mapsto u = \theta p'+(1-\theta )p$ for $\theta \in [0,1]$. Afterwards we give an upper-bound for this determinant that has no singularity in both $p$ and $q$ variables. Next we give an example where we prove that the Jacobian goes to zero in a specific pointwise limit. We further explain the results of our numerical study which shows that the Jacobian determinant has a very large number of distinct points at which it is machine zero. This generalizes the work of Glassey-Strauss (Transport Theory Statist. Phys. 20(1):55--68, 1991) and Guo-Strain (Comm. Math. Phys. 310(3):649--673, 2012). These conclusions make it difficult to envision a direct relativistic analog of the Newtonian cancellation lemma in the center-of-momentum coordinates.},

A major feature is the use of the Wiener space $A(\Omega)$, which can be expected to play a similar role to $L^\infty$. Compared to the $L^2$-based solution spaces that were employed for prior known results, this function space enables us to establish a new global existence theory. One further feature is that, not only an initial value problem, but also an initial boundary value problem whose boundary conditions can be regarded as physical boundaries in some simple situation, are considered for both equations. 
In addition to unique existence, large-time behavior of the solutions and propagation of spatial regularity are also proved. In the end of report, key ideas of the proof will be explained in a concise way.},

	abstract = {This paper proves the existence of small-amplitude global-in-time unique mild
solutions to both the Landau equation including the Coulomb potential and the
Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff. Since the well-known works (Guo,
2002) and (Gressman-Strain-2011, AMUXY-2012) on the construction of classical
solutions in smooth Sobolev spaces which in particular are regular in the
spatial variables, it still remains an open problem to obtain global solutions
in an $L^\infty_{x,v}$ framework, similar to that in (Guo-2010), for the
Boltzmann equation with cutoff in general bounded domains. One main difficulty
arises from the interaction between the transport operator and the
velocity-diffusion-type collision operator in the non-cutoff Boltzmann and
Landau equations; another major difficulty is the potential formation of
singularities for solutions to the boundary value problem. In the present work
we introduce a new function space with low regularity in the spatial variable
to treat the problem in cases when the spatial domain is either a torus, or a
finite channel with boundary. For the latter case, either the inflow boundary
condition or the specular reflection boundary condition is considered. An
important property of the function space is that the $L^\infty_T L^2_v$ norm,
in velocity and time, of the distribution function is in the Wiener algebra
$A(\Omega)$ in the spatial variables. Besides the construction of global
solutions in these function spaces, we additionally study the large-time
behavior of solutions for both hard and soft potentials, and we further justify
the property of propagation of regularity of solutions in the spatial
variables.},

These large time decay rates are the same as the optimal rate for the linear Muskat equation.  We also prove analogous results in 2D.},

	abstract = {We consider the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system with data of unrestricted size and without compact support in momentum space. In the two dimensional and the two-and-a-half dimensional cases, Glassey-Schaeffer proved (Commun Math Phys 185:257--284, 1997; Arch Ration Mech Anal 141:331--354, 1998; Arch Ration Mech Anal. 141:355--374, 1998) that for regular initial data with compact momentum support this system has unique global in time classical solutions. In this work we do not assume compact momentum support for the initial data and instead require only that the data have polynomial decay in momentum space. In the 2D and the $2\frac 12$D cases, we prove the global existence, uniqueness and regularity for solutions arising from this class of initial data. To this end we use Strichartz estimates and prove that suitable moments of the solution remain bounded. Moreover, we obtain a slight improvement of the temporal growth of the $L^\infty_x$ norms of the electromagnetic fields compared to (Commun Math Phys 185:257--284, 1997; Arch Ration Mech Anal 141:355--374, 1998).  In the three dimensional case, we apply Strichartz estimates and moment bounds to show that a regular solution can be extended as long as 
$\|(p^0)^{\theta} f \|_{L^q_xL^1_{p}}$ remains bounded for $\theta>{2/q}$ and $q \in (2, \infty]$. This improves previous results of Pallard (Indiana Univ Math J 54(5):1395--1409, 2005; Commun Math Sci 13(2):347--354, 2015).},

Splash singularities have been shown to hold for the free boundary incompressible Euler equation in the form of the water waves contour evolution problem (Castro A, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:733-738). Our result confirms the numerical simulations in (C{\'o}rdoba D, et al.

Here we prove that maintaining control of the curvature will remove the possibility of pointwise interphase collapse. Another conclusion that we provide is a better understanding of the work (C{\'o}rdoba D, Gancedo F (2010) Comm Math Phys 299:561-575) in which squirt singularities are ruled out; in this case a positive volume of fluid between the contours can not be ejected in finite time.},

	abstract = {The Muskat problem models the dynamics of the interface between two incompressible immiscible fluids with different constant densities.
In this work we prove three results.  First we prove an $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ maximum principle, in the form of a new ``log''  conservation law which is satisfied by the equation for the interface.  Our second result is a proof of global existence of Lipschitz continuous solutions for initial data that satisfy 
$\|f_0\|_{L^\infty}<\infty$ and $\|\partial_x f_0\|_{L^\infty}<1$. We take advantage of the fact that the bound $\|\partial_x f_0\|_{L^\infty}<1$ is propagated by solutions, which grants strong compactness properties in comparison to the log conservation law.
Lastly, we prove a global existence result for unique strong solutions if the initial data is smaller than an explicitly computable constant, for instance $\| f\|_1 \le 1/5$. Previous results of this sort used a small constant $\epsilon \ll1$ which was not explicit.},

	abstract = {In the study of solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation, their
regularity with respect to the momentum variables has been an outstanding
question, even local in time, due to the initially unexpected growth in the
post-collisional momentum variables which was discovered in 1991 by Glassey
\& Strauss. We establish momentum regularity within energy
spaces via a new splitting technique and interplay between the
Glassey-Strauss frame and the center of mass frame of the relativistic collision
operator. In a periodic box, these new momentum regularity estimates lead to
a proof of global existence of classical solutions to the two-species
relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system for charged particles near

	abstract = {The Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann System governs the time evolution of
the distribution function for the dilute charged particles in the
presence of a self-consistent electric potential force through the
Poisson equation. In this paper, we are concerned with the rate of
convergence of solutions to equilibrium for this system over $R^3_x$.
It is shown that the electric field which is indeed responsible for
the lowest-order part in the energy space reduces the speed of
convergence and hence the dispersion of this system over the full
space is slower than that of the Boltzmann equation without forces,
where the exact difference between both power indices in the
algebraic rates of convergence is $1/4$. For the proof, in the
linearized case with a given non-homogeneous source,  Fourier
analysis is employed to obtain time-decay properties of the solution
operator. In the nonlinear case, the combination of the linearized
results and the nonlinear energy estimates with the help of the
proper Lyapunov-type inequalities leads to the optimal time-decay
rate of perturbed solutions under some conditions on initial data.},

for initial perturbations of the Maxwellian equilibrium states.  
We  more generally cover collision kernels with parameters $s\in (0,1)$ and $\gamma$ satisfying 
$\gamma  > -n$ in arbitrary dimensions $\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 2$.  
Moreover, we prove rapid convergence as predicted by the celebrated Boltzmann $H$-theorem.
When $\gamma \ge -2s$, we have  exponential time decay to the Maxwellian equilibrium states.  When $\gamma <-2s$, our solutions decay polynomially fast in time with any rate.  
These results are completely constructive.  Additionally, we prove  sharp constructive upper and lower bounds for the linearized collision operator in terms of a geometric fractional Sobolev norm; we thus observe that a spectral gap exists only when $\gamma  \ge -2s$, as conjectured in  Mouhot-Strain.  It will be observed that this fundamental equation, derived by both Boltzmann  and Maxwell, grants a basic example where a range of geometric fractional derivatives occur in a physical model of the natural world.

	abstract = {In this paper we prove new constructive coercivity estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator without cutoff, that is for {\em long-range} interactions. 
In particular we give a generalized sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap which involves both the growth behavior of the collision kernel at large relative velocities and its singular behavior at grazing and frontal collisions. It provides in particular existence of a spectral gap and estimates on it for interactions deriving from the hard potentials $\phi(r)=r^{-(s-1)}$, $s \ge 5$ or the so-called moderately soft potentials $\phi(r)=r^{-(s-1)}$, $3< s < 5$, (without angular cutoff). 
In particular this paper recovers (by constructive means), improves and extends previous results of Pao 1974. We also obtain constructive coercivity estimates for 
the Landau collision operator for the optimal coercivity norm pointed out in Guo 2002 and we formulate a conjecture about a unified necessary and sufficient condition 
for the existence of a spectral gap for Boltzmann and Landau linearized collision operators. },

There were 50 participants, among which 15 young participants (PhD students, post-docs or young assistant professors). Two of them (M.-P. Gualdani and R. Strain) were invited within the program "US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows": they are promising young researchers working in the US. The program of the meeting was made in such a way that a lot of time remained for people to meet informally and discuss about scientific issues. It also ensured that almost everybody attended all (or most of) the scheduled talks. The program was structured in the following way: three subtopics were defined (relationships between micro/meso/macroscopic models; kinetic theory for complex particles: granular media, coagulation/fragmentation, chemotaxis and sprays; quantum mechanical kinetic theory). For each subtopic, there were a few (2 or 3) longer talks (about 40 minutes) by senior participants. For those talks, a specific effort of clarity was asked to the speakers, and the subject had to be rather broad. Then, shorter talks of about 20 minutes were planned, on more specialized issues. Finally, a special (much longer) talk in two parts was presented by one of the participants (C. Villani), in order to describe in a very didactical way an emerging link between kinetic theory, optimal transport, and Riemannian geometry. Some participants did not give a talk within this program, but organized an informal discussion around a poster, with an audience composed of specially interested people.},

These $L^\infty$ bounds have been known to be a challenging open problem in relativistic kinetic theory. To accomplish this, we establish two types of estimates for the gain part of the collision operator: first, we prove a potential type estimate and a relativistic hyper-surface integral estimate. We then combine those estimates using the relativistic counter-part of the Carleman representation to derive uniform control of the gain term for the relativistic collision operator. This allows us to prove the desired propagation of the uniform bounds of the solution. We further present two applications of the propagation of the uniform upper bounds: first we give another proof of the Boltzmann $H$-theorem, and second we prove the asymptotic convergence of solutions to the relativistic Maxwellian equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The collisional Kinetic Equations we study are all of the form
$$\partial_t F + v\cdot \nabla_x F+V(t,x)\cdot \nabla_v F=Q(F,F).$$
Here $F=F(t,x,v)$ is a probabilistic density function (of time $t\ge 0$, space $x\in\Omega$ and velocity $v\in\mathbb{R}^3$) for a particle taken chosen randomly from a gas or plasma. $V(t,x)$ is a field term which usually represents Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism, sometimes this term is neglected.   $Q(F,F)$ is the collision operator which models the interaction between colliding particles.  We consider both the Boltzmann and Landau collision operators.  


We prove existence, uniqueness and regularity of close to equilibrium solutions to the relativistic Landau-Maxwell system in the first part of this thesis.  Our main tool is an energy method.  

In the second part, we prove arbitrarily high polynomial time decay rates to equilibrium for four kinetic equations.  These are cutoff soft potential Boltzmann and Landau equations, but also the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system and the relativistic Landau-Maxwell system.  The main technique used here is interpolation.  

In the third part, we prove exponential decay for the cutoff soft potential Boltzmann and Landau equations.  The main point here is to show that exponential decay of the initial data is propagated by a solution.  

In the fourth and final part of this thesis, we write down a few important calculations in the relativistic Boltzmann theory which are scattered around the literature.  We also calculate a few Lorentz transformations which maybe useful in relativistic transport theory.  We use these calculations to comment about extending the results in this thesis to the relativistic Boltzmann equation.
