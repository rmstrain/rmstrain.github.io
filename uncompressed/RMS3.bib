	Abstract = {The Peskin problem models the dynamics of a closed elastic filament immersed
in an incompressible fluid. In this paper, we consider the case when the inner
and outer viscosities are possibly different. This viscosity contrast adds
further non-local effects to the system through the implicit non-local relation
between the net force and the free interface. We prove the first global
well-posedness result for the Peskin problem in this setting. The result
applies for medium size initial interfaces in critical spaces and shows instant
analytic smoothing. We carefully calculate the medium size constraint on the
initial data. These results are new even without viscosity contrast.},

	Abstract = {This article considers a long-outstanding open question regarding the Jacobian determinant for the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the center-of-momentum coordinates. For the Newtonian Boltzmann equation, the center-of-momentum coordinates have played a large role in the study of the Newtonian non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, in particular we mention the widely used cancellation lemma by Alexandre et al. (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 152(4):327–355, 2000). In this article we calculate specifically the very complicated Jacobian determinant, in ten variables, for the relativistic collision map from the momentum $p$ to the post collisional momentum $p'$; specifically we calculate the determinant for $p\mapsto u = \theta p'+(1-\theta )p$ for $\theta \in [0,1]$. Afterwards we give an upper-bound for this determinant that has no singularity in both $p$ and $q$ variables. Next we give an example where we prove that the Jacobian goes to zero in a specific pointwise limit. We further explain the results of our numerical study which shows that the Jacobian determinant has a very large number of distinct points at which it is machine zero.

The Boltzmann equation is perhaps the most widely used partial differential equation in Kinetic theory.  However the Boltzmann equation does not make sense for the important Coulomb interactions. In 1936, Landau introduced a correction to the Boltzmann equation that is generally used to model a dilute hot plasma where fast moving particles interact via Coulomb interactions.  This partial differential equation, which is now called the Landau equation, does not include the effects of Einstein's theory of special relativity. However for  particle velocities that are close to the speed of light, which occurs commonly in a hot plasma, then relativistic effects are very important. The relativistic version of Landau's equation was derived by Budker and Beliaev in 1956.  It is a fundamental model for studying the dynamics of a dilute collisional plasma. \\ \indent

Moreover, we obtain a slight improvement of the temporal growth of the $L^\infty_x$ norms of the electromagnetic fields compared to (Commun Math Phys 185:257--284, 1997; Arch Ration Mech Anal 141:355--374, 1998).  In the three dimensional case, we apply Strichartz estimates and moment bounds to show that a regular solution can be extended as long as 
$\|(p^0)^{\theta} f \|_{L^q_xL^1_{p}}$ remains bounded for $\theta>{2/q}$ and $q \in (2, \infty]$. This improves previous results of Pallard (Indiana Univ Math J 54(5):1395--1409, 2005; Commun Math Sci 13(2):347--354, 2015).},

	Abstract = {In this paper for either the sharp front Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation or the Muskat problem we rule out the `'splash singularity'' blow-up scenario; in other words we prove that the contours evolving from either of these systems can not intersect at a single point while the free boundary remains smooth. Splash singularities have been shown to hold for the free boundary incompressible Euler equation in the form of the water waves contour evolution problem (Castro A, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:733-738). Our result confirms the numerical simulations in (C{\'o}rdoba D, et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:5949-5952) where it is shown that the curvature blows up due to the contours collapsing at a point. Here we prove that maintaining control of the curvature will remove the possibility of pointwise interphase collapse. Another conclusion that we provide is a better understanding of the work (C{\'o}rdoba D, Gancedo F (2010) Comm Math Phys 299:561-575) in which squirt singularities are ruled out; in this case a positive volume of fluid between the contours can not be ejected in finite time.},

	Abstract = {The Muskat problem models the dynamics of the interface between two incompressible immiscible fluids with different constant densities.
In this work we prove three results.  First we prove an $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ maximum principle, in the form of a new ``log''  conservation law which is satisfied by the equation for the interface.  Our second result is a proof of global existence of Lipschitz continuous solutions for initial data that satisfy 
$\|f_0\|_{L^\infty}<\infty$ and $\|\partial_x f_0\|_{L^\infty}<1$. We take advantage of the fact that the bound $\|\partial_x f_0\|_{L^\infty}<1$ is propagated by solutions, which grants strong compactness properties in comparison to the log conservation law.
Lastly, we prove a global existence result for unique strong solutions if the initial data is smaller than an explicitly computable constant, for instance $\| f\|_1 \le 1/5$. Previous results of this sort used a small constant $\epsilon \ll1$ which was not explicit.},

$\partial_t u = ((-\Delta)^{-1}u)\Delta u + \alpha u^2$.  The initial condition $u_0$ is positive, radial, and non-increasing with
$u_0\in L^1\cap L^{2+\delta}({\mathbb R}^3)$ for some small $\delta >0$.  There is no size restriction on $u_0$.
This model problem appears of interest due to its structural similarity with Landau's equation from plasma physics, and moreover its radically different behavior from the semi-linear Heat equation: $u_t = \Delta u + \alpha u^2$. },

	Abstract = {The Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann System governs the time evolution of
the distribution function for the dilute charged particles in the
presence of a self-consistent electric potential force through the
Poisson equation. In this paper, we are concerned with the rate of
convergence of solutions to equilibrium for this system over $R^3_x$.
It is shown that the electric field which is indeed responsible for
the lowest-order part in the energy space reduces the speed of
convergence and hence the dispersion of this system over the full
space is slower than that of the Boltzmann equation without forces,
where the exact difference between both power indices in the
algebraic rates of convergence is $1/4$. For the proof, in the
linearized case with a given non-homogeneous source,  Fourier
analysis is employed to obtain time-decay properties of the solution
operator. In the nonlinear case, the combination of the linearized
results and the nonlinear energy estimates with the help of the
proper Lyapunov-type inequalities leads to the optimal time-decay
rate of perturbed solutions under some conditions on initial data.},

	Abstract = {This work proves the global stability of the Boltzmann equation (1872) with the physical collision kernels derived by Maxwell in 1866 for the full range of inverse-power intermolecular potentials, $r^{-(p-1)}$ with $p>2$,
for initial perturbations of the Maxwellian equilibrium states.  
We  more generally cover collision kernels with parameters $s\in (0,1)$ and $\gamma$ satisfying 
$\gamma  > -n$ in arbitrary dimensions $\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 2$.  
Moreover, we prove rapid convergence as predicted by the celebrated Boltzmann $H$-theorem.
When $\gamma \ge -2s$, we have  exponential time decay to the Maxwellian equilibrium states.  When $\gamma <-2s$, our solutions decay polynomially fast in time with any rate.  
These results are completely constructive.  Additionally, we prove  sharp constructive upper and lower bounds for the linearized collision operator in terms of a geometric fractional Sobolev norm; we thus observe that a spectral gap exists only when $\gamma  \ge -2s$, as conjectured in  Mouhot-Strain.  It will be observed that this fundamental equation, derived by both Boltzmann  and Maxwell, grants a basic example where a range of geometric fractional derivatives occur in a physical model of the natural world.  Our methods provide a new  understanding of the grazing collisions in the Boltzmann theory. },

	Abstract = {Consider axisymmetric strong solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations  in $R^3$ with non-trivial swirl.  Such solutions are not known to be globally defined, but it is shown by Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg in 1982 that they could only blow up on the axis of symmetry.  Let $z$ denote the axis of symmetry and $r$ measure the distance 
to the $z$-axis.   Suppose the solution satisfies the pointwise scale invariant bound $|v (x,t)| \le C_*{(r^2 -t)^{-1/2}} $ for $-T_0\le t < 0$ and a positive finite constant $C_*$ which is  allowed to be large,  we then prove that $v$ is regular at time zero. },

	Abstract = {In this paper we prove new constructive coercivity estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator without cutoff, that is for {\em long-range} interactions. 
In particular we give a generalized sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral gap which involves both the growth behavior of the collision kernel at large relative velocities and its singular behavior at grazing and frontal collisions. It provides in particular existence of a spectral gap and estimates on it for interactions deriving from the hard potentials $\phi(r)=r^{-(s-1)}$, $s \ge 5$ or the so-called moderately soft potentials $\phi(r)=r^{-(s-1)}$, $3< s < 5$, (without angular cutoff). 
In particular this paper recovers (by constructive means), improves and extends previous results of Pao 1974. We also obtain constructive coercivity estimates for 
the Landau collision operator for the optimal coercivity norm pointed out in Guo 2002 and we formulate a conjecture about a unified necessary and sufficient condition 
for the existence of a spectral gap for Boltzmann and Landau linearized collision operators. },

	Abstractow = {The Oberwolfach meeting described here aimed at presenting the latest mathematical results in the field of kinetic theory (both classical and quantum). There were 50 participants, among which 15 young participants (PhD students, post-docs or young assistant professors). Two of them (M.-P. Gualdani and R. Strain) were invited within the program "US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows": they are promising young researchers working in the US. The program of the meeting was made in such a way that a lot of time remained for people to meet informally and discuss about scientific issues. It also ensured that almost everybody attended all (or most of) the scheduled talks. The program was structured in the following way: three subtopics were defined (relationships between micro/meso/macroscopic models; kinetic theory for complex particles: granular media, coagulation/fragmentation, chemotaxis and sprays; quantum mechanical kinetic theory). For each subtopic, there were a few (2 or 3) longer talks (about 40 minutes) by senior participants. For those talks, a specific effort of clarity was asked to the speakers, and the subject had to be rather broad. Then, shorter talks of about 20 minutes were planned, on more specialized issues. Finally, a special (much longer) talk in two parts was presented by one of the participants (C. Villani), in order to describe in a very didactical way an emerging link between kinetic theory, optimal transport, and Riemannian geometry. Some participants did not give a talk within this program, but organized an informal discussion around a poster, with an audience composed of specially interested people.},

	Abstract = {The collisional Kinetic Equations we study are all of the form
$$\partial_t F + v\cdot \nabla_x F+V(t,x)\cdot \nabla_v F=Q(F,F).$$
Here $F=F(t,x,v)$ is a probabilistic density function (of time $t\ge 0$, space $x\in\Omega$ and velocity $v\in\mathbb{R}^3$) for a particle taken chosen randomly from a gas or plasma. $V(t,x)$ is a field term which usually represents Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism, sometimes this term is neglected.   $Q(F,F)$ is the collision operator which models the interaction between colliding particles.  We consider both the Boltzmann and Landau collision operators.  


We prove existence, uniqueness and regularity of close to equilibrium solutions to the relativistic Landau-Maxwell system in the first part of this thesis.  Our main tool is an energy method.  

In the second part, we prove arbitrarily high polynomial time decay rates to equilibrium for four kinetic equations.  These are cutoff soft potential Boltzmann and Landau equations, but also the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system and the relativistic Landau-Maxwell system.  The main technique used here is interpolation.  

In the third part, we prove exponential decay for the cutoff soft potential Boltzmann and Landau equations.  The main point here is to show that exponential decay of the initial data is propagated by a solution.  

In the fourth and final part of this thesis, we write down a few important calculations in the relativistic Boltzmann theory which are scattered around the literature.  We also calculate a few Lorentz transformations which maybe useful in relativistic transport theory.  We use these calculations to comment about extending the results in this thesis to the relativistic Boltzmann equation.
